First of all intake of fresh food supply our bodies with vitamins, minerals and fibers and helps organism to fight against viruses and colds. Secondly, placing a bowl of fruits directly on workers desk it saves time of unnecessary recessions and going to the kitchen/fridge to get some (combined with small talks to colleagues it takes a lot of time indeed).Thus wise bosses invest in employees good health and well-being, to prevent them from sickness leaves and keep the productivity.

We all know their great health benefits, for example green fruits bring iron and minerals to the body, while citrus fruits are giving us  vitamin C, so I'm not stopping on its nutritional value here. What we sometimes neglect is that jolly and bright colors of the fruits have positive impact on the mood and stimulate the brain. Every color has a different meaning and focus on particular body functions, so it's good to have as many kinds as possible.

**Red fruits (all kinds of berries, cherries, apples, etc.)** are set to be energizing, vitalizing and stimulating. They have high detoxing effect and bestows straight and confidence. Red is the color of blood and can shock, frighten and repulse (no wander it is so widely used in alarming signs, indicating danger) but it also drains attention and helps the concentration. Red is linked with Root Chakra, responsible for healing with the positive movement of blood.

**Blue (violet, indigo)** is an introspective color, corresponding with intuition, physical calmness, perception and spirituality. The color of fruits like blueberries, plums helps to reveal the subconscious abilities and allow deep knowledge. These fruits reflect the nervous system and brain relaxation. Indigo color corresponds with the Third Eye Chakra, connected with the intelligence and physic powers.

**Green** is recognized as the color of nature. It symbolizes harmony, balance, peace, freshness and freedom. It reduces the stress and emotional pressure. When it comes to healthy menu green leafy vegetables and fruits are mostly recommended for its high content of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Green color helps on physical and mental relaxation and copes with depressive, nervous and anxious conditions. Green deals with Hearth Chakra.

**Yellow** is sunny, vibrant, cheerful and warm color. It is said to be a symbol of inspiration, creativity, broadness of mind and knowledge. Yellow fruits are highly effective in the learning process as they develop the logical thinking ability and stimulates the brain activity. Yellow is connected with Solar Plexus Chakra, representing the identity an concept of yourself.

**Orange** is the color of positive emotions, joy, optimism and social communication. Fruits from this group (such as oranges, apricots, peaches, pumpkins, etc.) stimulate blood circulation, digestion and reproductive systems. This color is a great motivator, helps to accept the changes and challenges and boost the self esteem. Orange is  linked with the Sacral Chakra, responsible for reproductive system and sexuality.

In order to maximize the effect of the fruits you may eat them in its appropriate time of the day: start with green and yellow in the morning, orange and red during the working day and blue and violet in the evening (it helps against sleeping disorders).

You may have notice how often there is proclaimed brain stimulating and memory boosting in the above paragraphs. Fruits have extremely positive effect on these (just like raw carrots, nuts, etc.) due to their high content of natural sugars. And yes, it is also an explanation why fruits lift up our mood. The other two major elements in fruits are water and fibers. Water is always welcomed and as for fibers they are quite helpful against constipation, lazy guts, high blood pressure and heart disease, which are inconveniences widely spread among computer workers. And let's not forget that fruits are and excellent instrument to control one's body weight. 

After all said if a bowl of fruits on the desk still sounds too gay to you, keep them in the kitchen but at least think and eat of them more often and see the difference.
